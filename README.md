## Hi there, I'm Brad Costa, aka BCG-Development! 👋 

I'm a self-taught programmer and software engineer with around 5 years of coding experience. While I consider myself an amateur, I'm always eager to learn and grow in the world of technology.

- 💻 My preferred programming language: Python 🐍
- 🌐 A small background in C, C#, and C++
- 📚 Currently learning different database systems and SQL
- 🚀 Aspiring to turn my coding hobby into a full-time career

🌟 **Current Project**: [Route Solutions](https://github.com/BCG-Development/Route-Solutions)

I'm currently working on a project called Route Solutions. The goal is to create a program that can plan and optimize routes for the business I work for. I believe it has the potential to cut costs, save time, and provide insights by analyzing data from past weeks and months.

🤝 I'm open to collaboration and always looking for opportunities to contribute to exciting projects. Let's connect and code together!

Feel free to check out my GitHub stats and the languages I use the most in my repositories.

Thanks for visiting my profile! 🚀
